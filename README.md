TITLE: Students to use Autodesk Fusion 360 to research and develop a design on “Smart Glass Cleaning Robot”, which can climb, clean, and carry liquid cleaners.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
82.-  Research and develop a design on “Smart Glass Cleaning Robot”, which can climb, clean, and carry liquid cleaners.

IDEAS AND PROJECT DETAILS:
The "Smart Glass Cleaning Robot" project utilizing Autodesk Fusion 360 presents a multifaceted challenge integrating robotics, cleaning technology, and automation. The robot must be adept at climbing various surfaces, including vertical glass, while efficiently cleaning without leaving streaks or residue.

SKETCHING AND CONCEPTUALISATION:
- Begin by sketching rough ideas and concepts for the robot's structure and components.
- Utilize Fusion 360's sketching tools to create 2D sketches of the robot's body, cleaning mechanism, climbing features, and liquid carrying system.

3D MODELING:
- Translate your sketches into 3D models using Fusion 360's parametric modeling capabilities.
- Create components such as the robot's chassis, cleaning arms, suction cups for climbing, and reservoir for liquid cleaners.
- Ensure that the components fit together seamlessly and consider factors like weight distribution and balance.

ASSEMBLY:
- Assemble the individual components into the complete robot using Fusion 360's assembly environment.
- Use constraints and joints to define how the parts move and interact with each other.
- Verify that the assembly functions correctly and troubleshoot any interferences or conflicts.

SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS:
- Perform stress analysis and simulation to evaluate the structural integrity of the robot's components.
- Determine areas of potential weakness and reinforce them accordingly.
- Utilize Fusion 360's simulation tools to predict the robot's performance during climbing and cleaning tasks.
